Ebola virus disease
Ebola virus disease (EVD), or simply Ebola, is a viral haemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses.
Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches.
Vomiting, diarrhoea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys.
The disease has a high risk of death, killing 25% to 90% of those infected, with an average of about 50%.
Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD.
Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.
Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement.
Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution.
An Ebola vaccine was approved in the United States in December 2019.
EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa.
Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports 24 outbreaks involving 2,387 cases with 1,590 deaths.
The largest outbreak to date was the epidemic in West Africa, which occurred from December 2013 to January 2016, with 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths.
Other outbreaks in Africa began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2017, and 2018.
In July 2019, the World Health Organization declared the Congo Ebola outbreak a world health emergency.
Signs and symptoms
The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms (incubation period) is between two and 21 days, and usually between four and ten days.
Symptoms usually begin with a sudden influenza-like stage characterised by feeling tired, fever, weakness, decreased appetite, muscular pain, joint pain, headache, and sore throat.
The fever is usually higher than 38.3 °C (101 °F).
This is often followed by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sometimes hiccups.
Next, shortness of breath and chest pain may occur, along with swelling, headaches, and confusion.
This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms.
This may cause vomiting blood, coughing up of blood, or blood in stool.
Bleeding into the skin may create petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses or haematomas (especially around needle injection sites).
The incidence of bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract was reported to be ~58% in the 2001 outbreak in Gabon, but in the 2014-15 outbreak in the US it was ~18%, possibly due to improved prevention of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Recovery may begin between seven and 14 days after first symptoms.
Survivors develop antibodies against Ebola that last at least 10 years, but it is unclear whether they are immune to additional infections.
EVD in humans is caused by four of five viruses of the genus Ebolavirus.
The four are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV) and one simply called Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus).
EBOV, species Zaire ebolavirus, is the most dangerous of the known EVD-causing viruses, and is responsible for the largest number of outbreaks.
The fifth virus, Reston virus (RESTV), is not thought to cause disease in humans, but has caused disease in other primates.
All five viruses are closely related to marburgviruses.
Virology
Ebolaviruses contain single-stranded, non-infectious RNA genomes.
Ebolavirus genomes contain seven genes including 3'-UTR-NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L-5'-UTR.
This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid.
The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells.
The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins.
Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny.
Newly synthesised structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane.
The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.
It is believed that between people, Ebola disease spreads only by direct contact with the blood or other body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease.
The WHO states that only people who are very sick are able to spread Ebola disease in saliva, and whole virus has not been reported to be transmitted through sweat.
Most people spread the virus through blood, feces and vomit.
Entry points for the virus include the nose, mouth, eyes, open wounds, cuts and abrasions.
Ebola may be spread through large droplets; however, this is believed to occur only when a person is very sick.
Contact with surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus, particularly needles and syringes, may also transmit the infection.
The Ebola virus may be able to persist for more than three months in the semen after recovery, which could lead to infections via sexual intercourse.
Virus persistence in semen for over a year has been recorded in a national screening programme.
The virus was also found in the eye of one patient in 2014, two months after it was cleared from his blood.
The potential for widespread infections in countries with medical systems capable of observing correct medical isolation procedures is considered low.
Usually when someone has symptoms of the disease, they are unable to travel without assistance.
69% of the cases of Ebola infections in Guinea during the 2014 outbreak are believed to have been contracted via unprotected (or unsuitably protected) contact with infected corpses during certain Guinean burial rituals.
Health-care workers treating people with Ebola are at greatest risk of infection.
This risk is particularly common in parts of Africa where the disease mostly occurs and health systems function poorly.
Airborne transmission among humans is theoretically possible due to the presence of Ebola virus particles in saliva, which can be discharged into the air with a cough or sneeze, but observational data from previous epidemics suggests the actual risk of airborne transmission is low.
Therefore, pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough.
